# S&P 500 Equal Weight Shares Fund Project ðŸ“ˆ

## Overview

This project focuses on algorithmic trading, specifically through the implementation of an algorithm designed to assist in creating an equal-weight version of the S&P 500 index fund. The source code for this algorithm was guided by [Nick McCullum](https://www.nickmccullum.com/) and is part of an educational course.

### Context: Algorithmic Trading
- **Definition:** Algorithmic trading involves using computer algorithms for making investment decisions and executing trades automatically.
- **Application:** It leverages the speed and computational resources of computers to execute trades based on pre-set criteria.

### Project Mechanics
- **Functionality:** The script calculates the number of shares to purchase for each constituent of the S&P 500, based on the total value of an individual's portfolio. This aids in creating a portfolio that mirrors an equal-weight version of the index fund.
- **Technology Used:** The script interacts with financial data APIs and is executed in a Python environment.

## Implementation Date
- **Completion:** April 2023

## Learning Outcomes
- **Financial Data API:** Gained experience in using the IEX API for accessing financial data.
- **Python Environment Setup:** Learned how to set up a Python development environment in the terminal and integrate necessary libraries such as NumPy, pandas, and xlsxwriter.
- **Jupyter Notebook:** Utilized Jupyter Notebook for writing and testing the script, enhancing skills in interactive coding and data analysis.
